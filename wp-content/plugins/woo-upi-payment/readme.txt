== Description ==

This Plugin enables Woocommerce shopowners to get direct, instant payments through UPI apps like BHIM, Google Pay, Whatsapp, PayTM, PhonePe or any banking UPI app, thus saving payment gateway charges.

UPI is a payment standard owned by National Payment Corporation of India, a government owned entity. UPI works 24x7 and is free subject to prevalent government guidelines.

When this plugin is installed, a customer will see UPI as a payment option.  When he/she chooses it, it will take him/her to the list of installed UPI mobile applications. He/she can choose an app (like PayTM) and pay. 

In PCs, it will show a QR code that can be scanned by the UPI application and payment can be made. Payments come to the shopowners bank account directly. There is no payment gateway involved and saves money for shop owners
